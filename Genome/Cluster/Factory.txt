I've been couting down the days 
untill I pass through the gate for the last time
This smokestack like a beacon of industry,
heartbreaking vision when I passed beneath 
I remember I shaked worn hands of worker before I left
"Good luck they said you're not the first we get used to never attach to someone
I didn't look back
